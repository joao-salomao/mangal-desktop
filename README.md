# Mangal Desktop

Mangal Desktop is a desktop application that allows users to search, download, and manage their Manga virtual library.
It is built on top of [Mangal CLI](https://github.com/metafates/mangal) which is a command line interface for a similar
purpose. It is built using Tauri V2, Vue.js with Typescript, and a few other libraries.
